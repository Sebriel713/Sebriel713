- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sebriel713, I am student keen on bots and the blockchain infrastrucure. I am currently working in Telegram bots so as to sell them on Fiverr.
I'm currently learning all I can about bots and hope to start studying about bloackchain very soon. 
I also personally see the Machine Learning side of programming getting very important in the following years with the addition of Quantum Computers, so I'd also like to study that. 
 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bot related projects that may pick my interest.
